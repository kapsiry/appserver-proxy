= Application server proxy =

The goal of this project is to build an open source infrastructure
for hosting application servers. It is made for the needs of the
non-profit Kapsi Internet-käyttäjät (Internet users) for allowing
easier set-up of web projects needing application servers.

Very much a work in progress, do not expect this to be useful for
anyone yet.
